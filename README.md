## Environment Setup

This project reads API keys from a client-side environment file that is not committed to git.

1) Copy `env.example.js` to `env.js` in the project root.

```bash
cp env.example.js env.js
```

2) Open `env.js` and fill in your provider keys:

```js
window.ENV = {
  GROQ_API_KEY: "your-groq-key",
  OPENAI_API_KEY: "",
  ANTHROPIC_API_KEY: "",
  AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY: "",
  LOCAL_AI_API_KEY: ""
};
```

3) Ensure pages that call AI load `env.js` before `config.js` and your page scripts. Already configured in:

- `create-plan.html`: loads `env.js` then `config.js` then `create-plan.js`
- `all-study-plans.html`: loads `env.js`, `config.js`, `api-service.js`, `all-study-plans.js`
- `learning-interface.html`: loads `env.js`, `config.js`, `api-service.js`, `learning-interface.js`

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Open `index.html` in your browser
3. Navigate to the dashboard to explore learning features
4. Create personalized study plans

## Security Notes

- Do not commit real API keys. `env.js` is listed in `.gitignore`.
- `config.js` now reads keys from `window.ENV` and contains no secrets.
- For public deployments, route AI calls through a backend to avoid exposing keys in the browser.

## Git Workflow (first push)

Run these commands from the project root:

```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "chore: prepare repo, add env loader and docs"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin <YOUR_REPO_URL>
git push -u origin main
```
